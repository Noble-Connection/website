# Molecules

>  Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

Rules:

- Molecules cannot include any other molecules
- Should have one complete purpose/function (e.g. radio group or search component)
- Can include multiple related atoms to achieve a single function
